Left Hand
v
- Flip either x joystick or y joystick. directions are mixed up. I believe X is the correct one
- Lower the dead zone from 10% to <5%
- Why are fingers not tracking properly? Is there an issue with the wiring?
  - Look for proper wiring other than the breadboard. Daisychain the power and ground
  - Proper wire for pots (maybe hard wire on?)
- Any solution to delay delay of hand tracking from controller? -> maybe sol. in software setting
- Button fixes to translate better to Oculus Quest 2 button layout
