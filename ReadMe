This repo is for my LucidGlove firmware so I can keep track of my left and right hand changes with control flips and other changes. 
This firmware is from Lucas from the YouTube channel Lucas VRTech

The first iteration will be a direct fork of his firmware with later versions adding more components to the gloves

See Issues for current things on my to-do list. This will change and be updated when encountering new issues and leaving reminders for myself.
